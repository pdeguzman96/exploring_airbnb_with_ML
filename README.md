This is a simple data analysis & machine learning project. In this Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed the following 3 Airbnb listings datasets.

1. San Francisco, CA
2. New York, NY
3. Austin, TX

I used *Exploratory Data Analysis* techniques and some *machine learning* algorithms to answer the following three questions...

1. What are the strongest predictors for Airbnb listing price?
2. Do hosts with many properties give better or worse service than hosts with only one?
3. Do reviews matter when considering price?

In the analysis, I explain my thought processes and decisions as I go. I hope you find this interesting and useful!
